**BatStat**

BatStat is a battery information app for Macbooks. It has been verified as working on macOS 10.13 and 10.15 so far. Testing with signing certificates is, as yet, incomplete. Guidance will be provided on installation once alpha testing is complete. 

There will likely be additional installation steps as the app is not signed for distribution or with Developer ID. The reason for this is simple - this is currently my only macOS app, I am making it available for free, and as such the $99 per year fee to unlock signing makes no sense economically.

These installation steps wll be published below once confirmed.
